# Coupon Selection for Maximum Savings

## Overview
This project addresses the **Coupon Selection Problem**, where the goal is to maximize savings while adhering to multiple constraints such as coupon validity, maximum allowable coupons, and minimum spending requirements. The problem is tackled using three algorithmic approaches: **Greedy**, **Backtracking**, and **Dynamic Programming**.

## Features
- **Efficient Algorithms**:
  - Greedy Approach for quick and simple solutions.
  - Backtracking for guaranteed optimality on smaller datasets.
  - Dynamic Programming for optimal solutions on larger datasets.
- Comprehensive analysis of algorithm trade-offs, complexities, and use cases.
- User-friendly interface for managing and selecting coupons.

## Problem Description
Shoppers often deal with multiple coupons offering discounts under specific terms and conditions. This project provides a solution to:
1. Select the optimal subset of coupons to maximize savings.
2. Ensure constraints like validity, cost requirements, and limits on coupon usage are met.

The solution has practical applications in:
- Personal budgeting.
- E-commerce platforms optimizing coupon usage.
- Retail analytics and marketing strategies.

## Algorithmic Approaches
### 1. Greedy Approach
- **Strengths**: Simple, fast, and prioritizes coupons nearing expiration.
- **Limitations**: May not always yield the optimal solution.
- **Complexity**: `O(n log n)` time and `O(n)` space.

### 2. Backtracking
- **Strengths**: Explores all possible subsets, ensuring the optimal solution.
- **Limitations**: Computationally expensive for large datasets.
- **Complexity**: `O(2^n)` time and `O(n)` space.

### 3. Dynamic Programming
- **Strengths**: Balances efficiency and optimality by avoiding redundant calculations.
- **Limitations**: Higher memory usage.
- **Complexity**: `O(n * maxCoupons * userCost)` time and `O(maxCoupons * userCost)` space.

## File Structure
- `src/`: Source code for all approaches.
